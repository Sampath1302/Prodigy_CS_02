# Prodigy_CS_02
This code loads an image and applies a bitwise XOR operation to every pixel using a numeric key. XOR changes each pixel’s RGB values in a reversible way, so running the function once encrypts the image and running it again with the same key decrypts it back to the original. The script saves the modified image to a new fil
